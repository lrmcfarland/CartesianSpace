This directory contains the python wrappers for the Cartesian space objects.
They can be built by python with the command:

python setup.py build

setup.py assumes libSpace.dylib is built and located in ../../libSpace.

Once built you will need to add the module to your python path to use.
setenv.sh show some examples of how I set this on my iMac during
development.

pylaunch.sh will start an interpreter to test with.

lrmz-iMac:python lrm$ ./pylaunch.sh
