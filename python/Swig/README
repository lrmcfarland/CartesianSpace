This directory contains the swig python wrappers for the Cartesian
space objects.

This has some differences from the manual and Boost wrapped
versions. I have adapted the unit tests to have the same coverage
except where I needed to skip tests because of as yet unresolved
implementation differences.

The Makefile is setup to wrap and build the _space.so library. This
can simply be imported directly when the interpreter is run in this
directory.
