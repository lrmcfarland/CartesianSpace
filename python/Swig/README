This directory contains the swig python wrappers for the Cartesian
space objects.

This has some significant differences from the manual and Boost
wrapped versions. The extension feature has allowed me to implement
things like operator==() that are not done in the others. However I
have not yet figured out how to make the accessors behave like
properties the way they do in Boost and manually. I have adapted the
unit tests to have the same coverage except where I needed to skip
tests because of implementation differences.

The Makefile is setup to wrap and build the _space.so library. This
can simply be imported directly when the interpreter is run in this
directory.
