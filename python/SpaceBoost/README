This directory contains the Boost generated python wrappers for the
Cartesian space object.

It assumes boost, http://www.boost.org/more/getting_started/unix-variants.html,
has been installed.  See the boost documentation for python in other locations
options if you do not want to alter your default.

Once boost is installed, this builds like other python modules:

python setup.py build

setup.py assumes libSpace.dylib is built and located in ../../libSpace.
This can ge changed by setting the CARTESIAN_LIBRARY_PATH environment
variable. See setenv.sh for details.

Once built you will need to add the module to your python path to use.
setenv.sh show some examples of how I set this on my iMac during
development.

pylaunch.sh will start an interpreter to test with.
