This repo contains examples of how to wrap c++ objects in python. It is an
implementation of a Cartesian coordinate system built around three double 
precision floating point numbers. The space objects support vector arithmetic
by overloading the +, -, * and / operators, where * is the dot product and /
scales. There is a separate function for cross product.

With a c++ simulation model wrapped in python, the position and
velocity of a given body can easily be converted to a new coordinate
system (e.g. centered on the moon) or have calculated quantities like
the angular momentum over time plotted.
