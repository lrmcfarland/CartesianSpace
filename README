This repo contains examples of how to wrap c++ objects in python. It is an
implementation of a Cartesian coordinate system built around three double 
precision floating point numbers. The space objects support vector arithmetic
by overloading the +, -, * and / operators, where * is the dot product and /
scales. There is a separate function for cross product.

It is a submodule of my Orbits simulation program. With the c++
simulation model wrapped in python, the position and velocity of a
given body can easily be converted to a new coordinate system
(e.g. centered on the moon) or have calculated quantities like the
angular momentum over time plotted. A demo is available on my web-site
starbug.com.
