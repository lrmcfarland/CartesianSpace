This is my C++ implementation of a Cartesian space object for use in
physics applications as a full featured C++ object. It is built around
three doubles for x, y and z. The math operators are overloaded to
support vector arithmetic.

This uses Google's gtest unit testing. The makefile uses GTEST_DIR to
locate where it is installed. You do not need gtest to build the
library.
