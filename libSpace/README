This is my C++ implementation of a Cartesian space object built around
three doubles for x, y and z for use with computer models of space
craft in transfer orbits.

This uses Google's gtest, http://code.google.com/p/googletest/, for
unit testing. The makefile uses GTEST_DIR to locate where it is
installed. You do not need gtest to build the library.
